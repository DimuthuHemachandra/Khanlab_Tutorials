## Current thoughts 

*Have the tutorials done on Friday mornings (9.30 to 12) starting at the beginning of September. 

*Each tutorial takes around 2 hours with a 10 minutes break with refreshments during the 2 hours.

*Must have a tutorial outline and sample data/task for everyone to work on.

*Tutorials will be recored and will make available for new students.
